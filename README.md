# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-

This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the classic Titanic Dataset, helping uncover hidden insights and relationships between features that contributed to passenger survival.

Objective
To analyze passenger demographics, ticketing, and survival information using descriptive statistics and powerful visualizations.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries Used
Python 
Pandas ‚Äì Data manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn ‚Äì Data visualization
Jupyter Notebook / Python Script


 Key Analysis Steps
Summary statistics of all features
Class distribution of the Survived column
Histograms of numeric features like Age, Fare, SibSp, and Parch
Boxplots to detect outliers and data spread
Pairplots showing interactions between survival and other key features
Correlation matrix to find linear relationships
Insightful inferences based on visuals

 Features Used
Survived ‚Äì Binary indicator of survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass ‚Äì Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked


 Sample Insights
Higher-class passengers had higher survival rates.
Women had significantly better chances of survival.
Outliers exist in fare and age distributions.
Sibling/Spouse and Parent/Child counts provide context for family-based survival.
